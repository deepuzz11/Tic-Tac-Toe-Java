# Tic-Tac-Toe-Java

This Java program implements a simple Tic Tac Toe game using Swing for the graphical interface. Players can choose to play as 'X' or 'O', and there's an option to play against the computer.

## Getting Started

To run the Tic Tac Toe game, follow these steps:

1. Make sure you have Java installed on your system.
2. Compile the `TicTacToe.java` file.
3. Run the compiled program.

## How to Play

1. Select your symbol: 'X' or 'O'.
2. Make your move by clicking on an empty cell.
3. The computer will automatically make its move if you're playing against it.
4. The game ends when a player wins, or the board is filled (resulting in a draw).

## Game Rules

- Players take turns placing their symbol ('X' or 'O') on an empty cell of the 3x3 grid.
- The first player to get three of their symbols in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game.
- If all cells are filled and no player has achieved three in a row, the game ends in a draw.
